# CrackThatShell
Interviewing is a learned skill and it takes conscious efforts to master the skills. Programming interviews is flawed process, however until a better alternative if found programmers need to learn and master the skills needed to successfully crack the programming interviews. 

I have seem many talented developers failing in interviews simply because they have not practised well. This is an attempt to fill the gap.
